This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.


The goal is to extend the game:

  - add items to rooms (items may have weight)
  - add multiple players
  - add commands (pick, drop, examine, read, ...)
  - (anything you can think of, really...)
